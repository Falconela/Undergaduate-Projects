# 1. Actin Waves
  Different natural systems, such as biological cells, chemical reactions and ecological populations exhibit mechanisms of
  excitable pulses. These pulses propagate in an excitable media and their signature behavior is that upon collision they
  annihilate each other. One of the most interesting mechanisms is of intracellular actin waves. Actin waves, which
  appear on cell membranes, demonstrate different outcomes upon collision. One of these outcomes is annihilation,
  which relates to excitable pulses. Yet, regarding actin waves, there are other behaviors as well. The importance of studying these waves and their nature may be due to 
  the connection between them and the process of macropinocytosis. In this process cells grow actin-based vertical protrusions (ruffles)
  that collapse or fold back on either themselves or the cell body. The collapse creates enclosed cavities that are then
  internalized as vesicles (macropinosomes). The extracellular fluid inside of macropinosomes contains, for example,
  dissolved macromolecules that serve the nutrition of cells. These protrusions perform as a type of actin wave, that is,
  a propagating wave-front of actin polymerization at the dorsal cell side.
  
  In this project we examine a simplified, one-dimensional, reaction-diffusion model that describes the polymerization
  of actin and was formulated using a more complex circular dorsal ruffles model, as the similarity between the
  kinetics of the two phenomena is close .The purpose of this examination is to study different wave patterns that arise
  from this simplified model, through different numerical methods.
  
  # 2. Hofstadter Butterfly
    In condensed matter physics, Hofstadter's butterfly is a graph of the spectral properties of non-interacting two-dimensional electrons in a perpendicular magnetic 
    field in a lattice. The fractal, self-similar nature of the spectrum was discovered in the 1976 Ph.D. work of Douglas Hofstadter[1] and is one of the early examples 
    of modern scientific data visualization. The name reflects the fact that, as Hofstadter wrote, "the large gaps [in the graph] form a very striking pattern somewhat 
    resembling a butterfly.
    The Hofstadter butterfly plays an important role in the theory of the integer quantum Hall effect and the theory of topological quantum numbers.
